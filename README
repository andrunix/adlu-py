Steps for using this program


1) Get the list of users from AppWatch in a simple format, one user id per line. The text file we started with included user id\tuser name

2) Run the ampldap.py program to lookup the users in AD, get the manager, and produce the output file

   ampldap.py <infile name> <passwd>
   
   Output goes to STDOUT so simply redirect to a file 

# 3) Remove the header line from the output 

# 4) Sort the output on the 3rd column. 
#   sort -t$'\t' -k4 userout.txt >userouts.txt

#5) Open the output file and remove the lines at the top that only have a user id. These id's could not be located in Active Directory.

# 6) Run the program to read the sorted program and send emails
#   userproc.py
